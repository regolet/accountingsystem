## Development Tips

- You can use npm kill-port to kill the running ports and start the server
- Use `npm kill-port <port>` to specifically terminate a process running on a particular port
- Use `npx prisma migrate dev` for database migration to supabase (safer than db push)
- kill all ports first before running a server or restarting a server
